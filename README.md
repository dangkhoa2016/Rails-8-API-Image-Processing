This project is a Rails 8 API authentication service built with Devise and JWT. It supports registration, email confirmation, sign in, sign out, profile lookup, and user-management operations with admin-only access controls.

## Features

- User registration with `username` and email confirmation.
- JWT-based sign in and sign out with token revocation via denylist.
- Profile lookup with token metadata via `/user/profile` and compatibility aliases `/user/me`, `/user/whoami`.
- Self-service account update and account deletion.
- User active/inactive status — deactivated accounts are automatically blocked from signing in.
- Admin-only user listing, user creation, role updates, user deletion, account status toggling (lock/unlock), and email force-confirmation.
- Rate limiting on sign-in, registration, and password-reset endpoints.
- JWT denylist cleanup via Active Job and Rake task.
- Docker + Kamal deployment scaffolding with a health check endpoint.
- CI with Brakeman, RuboCop, the full Rails test suite, and a dedicated auth regression job.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies and prepare the database.

```bash
bin/setup
```

2. Start the application.

```bash
bin/dev
```

3. Call the API on `http://localhost:4000` by default. If you set `PORT` in your shell or `.env`, use that value instead.

4. Use the snippets in `manual/` as copy/paste references for auth and user-management requests:

- `manual/registration.sh`
- `manual/session.sh`
- `manual/password.sh`
- `manual/user.sh`

## Local Auth Quick Start

This flow is intended for a clean local checkout and matches the routes covered by the auth integration tests.

1. Start the app with `bin/dev` and keep it running on `http://localhost:4000` unless you have overridden `PORT`.

2. Register a new user in a separate terminal.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:4000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "username": "user1",
      "password": "password",
      "password_confirmation": "password"
    }
  }' | jq .
```

3. Fetch the confirmation token from the local database.

```bash
bin/rails runner 'puts User.find_by!(email: "user@example.com").confirmation_token'
```

4. Confirm the account.

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:4000/users/confirmation?confirmation_token=<token>" | jq .
```

5. Sign in and capture the JWT from the `Authorization` response header.

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -is -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/sign_in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password"
    }
  }' | sed -n 's/^authorization: Bearer //p' | tr -d '\r')
```

6. Read the primary profile endpoint with that JWT.

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:4000/user/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq .
```

7. Sign out and revoke the token.

```bash
curl -sS -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/users/sign_out \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq .
```

8. Optionally inspect the broader request references in `manual/session.sh`, `manual/registration.sh`, `manual/password.sh`, and `manual/user.sh` for invalid-token, expired-token, password-reset, and admin/user-management examples.

## Environment

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` for local development:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Recommended local settings for development:

```env
RAILS_ENV=development
RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true
PORT=4000
RAILS_MAX_THREADS=3
```

If you do not set `PORT`, `bin/dev` boots on `4000` locally. The shipped `.env.sample` sets `PORT=4000`, so copying it unchanged moves local development to `http://localhost:4000`. The full variable reference — including production secrets, Puma concurrency, mailer, admin seed, CORS, and the manual JWT token slot — is documented in `.env.sample`.

For browser clients running on a different origin, the default CORS config allows requests from `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` but does **not** expose the `Authorization` response header. If your frontend needs to read the JWT from the sign-in response, update `config/initializers/cors.rb` to expose that header explicitly.

## Code Coverage

Generate a coverage report locally with SimpleCov by running the test suite with `COVERAGE=1`:

```bash
COVERAGE=1 bin/rails test
```

When `COVERAGE=1` is set, the test suite runs without Rails parallel workers so the SimpleCov report stays accurate.

The report is written to `public/coverage`. While the Rails server is running in development, open `http://localhost:4000/coverage` to view the latest generated report. This development-only endpoint redirects to the static HTML report.

Internally, the app redirects `/coverage` to `/coverage/` before the static file server handles the request. The trailing slash matters because the generated SimpleCov HTML references assets with relative paths such as `./assets/...`.

## Current Route Contract

The route contract below reflects `config/routes.rb` and the current controller implementation.

### Authentication Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/users` | Register a new account |
| POST | `/users/sign_in` | Sign in and receive JWT in the `Authorization` response header |
| DELETE | `/users/sign_out` | Sign out and revoke the current token |
| GET | `/users/confirmation` | Confirm email via Devise confirmable flow |
| POST | `/users/password` | Send password reset instructions |
| PUT/PATCH | `/users/password` | Reset password with a token |
| PUT/PATCH | `/users` | Update the current signed-in account |
| DELETE | `/users` | Delete the current signed-in account |

### Profile Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/user/profile` | Primary profile endpoint |
| GET | `/user/me` | Compatibility alias |
| GET | `/user/whoami` | Compatibility alias |

All three profile routes hit the same controller action and return the same payload shape.

### Admin and User Management Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/users` | List users, admin only |
| POST | `/users/create` | Create a user as admin |
| GET | `/users/:id` | View a user; admin or self |
| PUT | `/users/:id` | Update a user; admin or self |
| DELETE | `/users/:id` | Delete a user; admin or self |

### Utility Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Root welcome endpoint |
| GET | `/home` | Welcome endpoint alias |
| GET | `/up` | Health check for uptime/load balancers |

## Request Format Notes

Devise endpoints expect payloads nested under the `user` key. For registration (`POST /users`), the `username` field is required.

Example sign-up request:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "user1",
    "password": "password",
    "password_confirmation": "password"
  }
}
```

Example sign-in request:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

Self-service account updates on `PUT /users` or `PATCH /users` must include `current_password`. Admin-managed updates on `PUT /users/:id` go through `UsersController` and do not require `current_password`.

Profile lookup also has two different unauthenticated failure modes:

- Missing, expired, or revoked token: `422` with `user: null` plus `token_info`
- Malformed token: `422` with `{ "error": "Invalid token" }`

## Example Flow

### 1. Register

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "username": "user1",
      "password": "password",
      "password_confirmation": "password"
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Confirm Email

Use the confirmation link generated by Devise, for example:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:4000/users/confirmation?confirmation_token=<token>"
```

### 3. Sign In

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/sign_in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password"
    }
  }'
```

The JWT is returned in the `Authorization` response header.

### 4. Read Profile

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/user/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>"
```

`/user/me` and `/user/whoami` are compatibility aliases for the same response.

### 5. Sign Out

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/users/sign_out \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>"
```
